# Flashcard deck (signature interaction)

`FlashcardDrillView` is a swipe deck: tap flips the card, and only a flipped
card can be swiped — right = "got it" (leaves the deck), left = "again"
(returns at the back). Pre-flip drags rubber-band. Undo lives in the toolbar.
Cards with a `CardChoice` show two answer buttons on the front (choose, graded
flip, held result, explicit Next). Their answer determines the grade and whether
the card returns; swipe direction never overrides it.

Gesture gotcha: the deck uses ONE `DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)` that treats
a <10pt release as the flip tap — a separate `.onTapGesture` loses arbitration
against the drag and silently never fires. Don't "simplify" it back to
`onTapGesture`.

Flip gotcha: the whole card must rotate as ONE unit — `FlipRotation` is
`Animatable` and swaps faces exactly at 90° while the card is edge-on. Never
rotate the text faces inside a static card background; that's what made text
detach from the card. `ElectricianCardFace` carries the card chrome (ivory
surface, double frame, eyebrow, watermark) — both faces use it.

`CalcDrillView` is deliberately NOT a flashcard: a worked calculation needs its
steps visible after the answer, so it has its own runner.
